- WSL2 enabled on Windows

## Building the Docker Image

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wsl-images/custom-ubuntu-example

```

2. Install docker image as WSL instance:

```

3. Launch your new WSL distribution:

```bash
wsl -d my-ubuntu-wsl
```

## What to Expect on First Run

On first run, the `wsl-setup` script will:
- Prompt you to create a user account (prefilled with your Windows username)
- Set up proper WSL permissions
- Configure the default user in `/etc/wsl.conf`
- Install the Ubuntu font in Windows (if possible)

## Included Software

This WSL image includes:

- Neovim
- Additional WSL configurations for better Windows integration

## Customization
